* Introduction

* Requirements
** For release v1.0.2
  1. ADS, when deployed on a machine (VM/container) creates containers on a
     specified machine running centos 6.6 and openVZ kernel 2.6.32-042stab103.6

  2. ADS, when deployed on a machine (VM/container) starts the =VMManager=
     service on port =9089= on the newly created containers.

** Deploying a Lab :: A case for using configuration management tools.
   To deploy a lab, there are two steps: 
   + Provision a VM
   + Install the lab on the provisioned VM.

   Provisioning and installation details are declared in a deployment
   specification file.

   One of the drawbacks of this approach is that abstraction happens at two
   levels: first when the deployment specification is defined by the integrator
   and second when the these declarations are interpreted while execution.  It
   might take several cycles of testing for the integrator to figure out the
   way the installer is interpreting the specification before getting it right.

   Also, the integrator might be asking for help from VLEAD while going through
   these cycles of testing.  VLEAD will have to invest some of it's engineering
   resources towards support. 

   To avoid these pitfalls, configuration tools can be used to our advantage.
   An integrator can be made entirely responsible for delivering a playbook (in
   ansible terms) which is self-contained and interpreted only by configuration
   manager (ansible in this case).

   In such a scenario. ADS role is limited to providing the playbook to the
   configuration server which would configure and install the lab on the
   provisioned machine.  Both lab integrator and ADS use the same configuration
   management tool precluding ambiguities, development and support.

   Lab integrator would still have to provide the specification of the machine
   on which the lab is deployed/configured.

** Life cycle management of labs
   Life cycle management is the ability to perform the following tasks on a
   lab: start, stop, backup, restore from a previous backup and test.  Having
   such functionality helps continuous releases of the software running the
   lab.  This management of a lab is achieved through a bunch of scripts -
   start, stop, backup, restore, test. These scripts are developed by the
   integrator.

   Auto deployment and life cycle management of labs enable continuous
   development, testing and release of software.  If the onus on the integrator
   is to make a lab auto-deployable with life-cycle management scripts, it is
   imperative for VLEAD to build a platform for continuous delivery
   
** Platform for Continuous Delivery

* Releases
** Release v1.0.2 
   ADS will run from a container and 
   + create a container on the base machine with centos and openvz, and
   + deploy a lab on this newly created container.
** Release v1.0.3
   ADS will run from a VM on amazon cloud and 
   + create a VM within AWS cloud, and 
   + deploy lab on this newly created VM.
